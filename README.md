# Model-Earth
3D globe with custom shaders using three.js

I included the three.js orbit controls to interact with the model.
The model earth has custom shaders for the atmosphere and light on the surface.
To create a more accurate model of the earth I added rotation to it with an addition of the moon orbiting the Earth.
